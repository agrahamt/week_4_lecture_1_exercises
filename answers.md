Why should you always link external JavaScript files at the end of the <body> tag?
A - because the browser delays parsing the html file (and loading content such as images) until after it has executed the Javascript script.  If you put the script tag at the end, the browser will load all the html content first.  This gives the appearance of a faster load to the user of your site.

Why is using comments important?
A - A coder uses comments to explain the purpose of the code, delineate distinct parts of the program, and clarify the decisions they made in creating the code.  If you make readable code that is well-commented, then any other coders will understand it better and easier, and you yourself won't remember the coding of the program if you return to it after a month or more, and will rely on your comments to understand it.
